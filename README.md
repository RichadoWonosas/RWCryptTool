# RWCryptTool

A pure front-end encryption tool using encryption algorithm RWSE2 and secure hash algorithm RWSH.

## Features

- [x] **WebAssembly acceleration** - Encryption and decryption involves massive computing power; At the same time the encryption algorithm RWSE2 uses 64-bit operations yet JavaScript does not support this well. WebAssembly is used to deal with this issue.
- [x] **Progressive Web App (PWA) Support** - This tool can be installed as a progressive web app. Feel free to install this app if the browser suggests you to do that!
